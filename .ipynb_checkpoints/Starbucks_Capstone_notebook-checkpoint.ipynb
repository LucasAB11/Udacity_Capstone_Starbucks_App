    "# Starbucks Capstone Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be given transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don't receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, you wouldn't want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. You'll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a capstone project, you are free to analyze the data any way you see fit. For example, you could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. Or you could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. Or, you don't need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A)."

    "# Project Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project a model will be built that predicts whether a customer will view and complete an offer based on the customer information and the offer characteristics. This prediction can then be used to identify the best offer to a customer based on how likely it is that the customer will be influenced by the offer. \n",
    "Any offer can fall into one of four categories on the viewed/completion matrix: \n",
    "\n",
    "|----------|Completed|Not Completed|\n",
    "|----------|---------|-------------|\n",
    "|Viewed|1|2|\n",
    "|Not Viewed|4|3|\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of each category can be ranked from most desirable (1) to least desirable (4). Based on this a simple recommendation function can be built that uses the insights gained from the models predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Design\n",
    "\n",
    "In a first step the datasets will be cleaned. This means dropping any customer profiles that are incomplete and the transactions recorded from these incomplete customer profiles. Next the transaction volume per customer per week will be added as additional information to the customer profiles. Lastly, a dataset that records all the offers sent to customers and their outcomes (i.e. whether they were viewed and whether they were completed) will be constructed. For every offer sent the personal information of the customer will be added to the offer dataset to construct the input dataset explained above. \n",
    "After the dataset has been split into test and training set, the Benchmark model will be trained to establish the Benchmark. \n",
    "Next several different Machine Learning models will be trained and tested to see which model performs best based on the evaluation metrics. \n",
    "Lastly, once the best model has been picked, a sample recommendation function will be introduced. This recommendation sample will take the customer ID as input and then predict the outcomes for the available offers for this customers. Once the outcomes are known a predetermined ranking will identify which offer is most suitable for the customer and this offer will be returned.\n",
    "To achieve this the project has been split into the following sections:\n",
    "0. Data Exploration\n",
    "1. Data Pre-Processing\n",
    "2. Data Exploration 2.0\n",
    "3. Creation of Training & Testing Sets\n",
    "4. Benchmark Model\n",
    "5. Machine Learning Models\n",

Once again the input dataset should consist of information about the customer and the offer type. The label is the category of the viewed/completed matrix the particular offer falls into. The customer information is made up of the information in the clean_profile dataframe as well as information about the transaction volume of the customer. The offer data comes from the portfolio dataframe. Most importantly, each offer that was received has to be filtered out of the transcript dataframe and put into a new dataframe where it can be sorted to show which offer was viewed and completed. "
